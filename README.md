# Heart-Failure-Dashboard
1)The Heart Failure Patient Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project is a healthcare analytics project that focuses on understanding and visualizing key factors influencing heart failure outcomes.
This interactive Power BI dashboard analyzes patient clinical records to uncover insights related to mortality risk, survival trends, and major health indicators such as age, blood pressure, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and diabetes.
The project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics skills — from data cleaning and transformation to visualization and storytelling — to support data-driven healthcare decisions and early diagnosis.

2) Key Highlights:
1)Analyzed 299 patient records with 13 clinical features.
2)Explored correlations between clinical conditions and death events.
3)Built dynamic and interactive dashboards using Power BI.
4)Delivered insightful visuals for better interpretation of patient outcomes.

3)Goal:
To leverage data analytics and visualization for identifying risk factors and patterns that can help improve early detection and treatment strategies in heart failure patients.

4)Tech Stack:
Key Technologies Used to Build the Dashboard:
1) Power BI – For data visualization, interactive dashboard design, and storytelling.
2) Microsoft Excel / CSV – For initial data exploration, cleaning, and preparation.
3) Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) – Used for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
4)DAX & Power Query – For data transformation, calculated columns, and custom measures in Power BI.
5)Kaggle Dataset – Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset (used as the data source.

5) Data Sources :
 Source: Kaggle – Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset
 Data Format: CSV file
 Records: 299 patients
 Features: 13 clinical features including:
 Age – Patient’s age in years
Anaemia – Decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (boolean)
Diabetes – Presence of diabetes (boolean)
High Blood Pressure – Presence of hypertension (boolean)
Ejection Fraction – Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction
Serum Creatinine – Level of creatinine in the blood (kidney function indicator)
Serum Sodium – Level of sodium in the blood
Time – Follow-up period (in days)
Death Event – Whether the patient died during the follow-up period (target variable)
Business Impact & Insights
